| Type                       | Purpose                 | Role                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MultiAgent Systems         | Cooperative Cognition    | Distributes intelligence across a network of agents that cooperate, compete, or coexist to achieve goals. Intelligence emerges from their interactions. |
| Reactive & Deliberative AI | Behavioral Modulation    | Combines two complementary agent behaviors: Reactive AI (fast, context-aware) and Deliberative AI (planning, reasoning, simulating consequences).       |


### Non Emergent AI


| Type            | Purpose                        | Role                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Neural Networks  | Learning & Recognizing Patterns | Computational models inspired by the brain. Learns from data via layered neurons adjusting weights. Foundational to modern AI but often lacks transparency.     |
| Symbolic AI      | Logic-Based Reasoning           | Uses symbols and logic to represent knowledge and perform reasoning. Interpretable and formal, but weak in noisy or ambiguous environments.                     |
| Classical ML     | Statistical Learning            | Traditional algorithms that learn from structured data without deep nets. Faster, more interpretable, and data-efficient. Ideal for transparent applications.   |
| Fuzzy Logic      | Gradient Reasoning              | Handles partial truths and ambiguity to make decisions in uncertain contexts. Common in real-world systems needing human-like or flexible reasoning.            |


### AI Intelligence Levels


| Type                     | Purpose                   | Role                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open-ended Intelligence  | Unbounded Adaptation       | Refers to systems that continuously generate novel goals, behaviors, and forms of cognition without being confined to fixed tasks or architectures. These systems evolve, self-organize, and increase in complexity over time. |
| Super Intelligence       | Cognitive Supremacy        | Refers to an AI that surpasses human intelligence across all domains, including creativity, social reasoning, and scientific discovery. Often seen as a successor to AGI. |
| AGI                      | General Reasoning          | Artificial General Intelligence is a machine's ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can, with comparable reasoning, learning, and adaptability. |
| Narrow AI                | Task Specialization        | AI systems that excel in narrow, specific tasks but lack the ability to generalize beyond them — often outperforming humans in those limited domains.           |
